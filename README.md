# Web server in C++ (HTTP/1.1)

Webserv is a project marking the introduction to socket programming. The objective is to develop an HTTP/1.1 compliant program that emulates the functionality of Nginx. Initially challenging, this project requires extensive documentation review to understand its complexities. It covers fundamental concepts such as sockets, HTTP requests and responses, headers, and CGI.

Thanks Antoine, loved your dedication for the project, your curiosity whether about the knowledge/concepts of websocket or the refactoring principles. Working with you made me more curious about the underlayings notions. Hope to work with you soon !
