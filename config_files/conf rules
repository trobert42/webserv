1. Only server blocks, no lines outside
2. To declare a block: needs to be written like “server {”, regardless of white spaces. And to close, only a “}” on a line
3. Directives syntax inside blocks must be: “[direc_name]:[direc_par1] [direc_par2]” (nbrs of param depends on the directive)
4. Location context needs to be written inside server
5. Comments not handled → error if we found ‘#’
6. same valid directives doublons: will take the last one
7. client max body size is in bytes
8. root is written without '/'
9. lists of directives we manage, their nbr of arg accepted, default value if not precised in default.conf:
	"listen",					0-1/ip and 1/port				127.0.0.1:8080
	"server_name",				0-no limits						webserv
	"root",						0-1								html

	"autoindex",				0-1								off
	"client_max_body_size",		0-1								1
	"allowed_methods",			1-3 but can remove doublons		GET POST DELETE
	"error_page",				0 || 2
